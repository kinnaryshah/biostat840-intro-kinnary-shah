    "text": "My name is Kinnary (kin-uh-ree) Shah. I’m currently a second year PhD candidate in the Biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Prior to this program, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Biomathematics and Public Health at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. My research interests lie in genomics data analysis and methods development. As an undergraduate student, I assessed methylation in the Drosophila melanogaster genome using Nanopore sequencing data under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Ellison. I completed several research fellowships at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the Ralph W. Voorhees Center for Civic Engagement, each of which drew me closer to biostatistics and genomics research. As a PhD student, I am working on methods development of spatial transcriptomics data in collaboration with Dr. Stephanie Hicks."

Based on Figure 1, we can see that crime rate does not increase steadily over time, and instead follows a yearly cyclical pattern. Crime does not stay constant and district is an important factor to consider. First, we will talk about monthly crime. Based on Figure 3: in each month, the crimes in the Northeastern and Southeastern district are the highest, while the crimes in the Western and Eastern districts are the lowest. There is more crime in summer months across districts. Second, we will talk about hourly crime. There is an increasing trend of crime after 5:00am that reaches its peak from 12:00pm to 8:00pm based on Figure 2. Law enforcement should increase resource allotment between the months of April and August to deal with increased crime. In addition, they should similarly focus daily resources between 3:00pm to 9:59pm due to the higher frequency of crime during those hours. Law enforcement should enact more safety programs and perhaps implement more/better trained police officers in the Northeastern and Southeastern districts. It is important to recognize that Baltimore community members may not feel safer with increased police presence due to the history of police violence in this community. This figure below from a report by Morgan State University shows the level of satisfaction with the Baltimore Police Department from a sample of residents (Pratt-Harris and Winbush 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDane, Sohier. 2017.
