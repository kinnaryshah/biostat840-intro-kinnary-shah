I aim to answer the question: how does crime rate depend on time and is crime rate constant over time? The intended audience for the data analysis is government officials of the city of Baltimore. The goal of this analysis is to reveal trends in crime rate that government officials can use to better allocate resources. The data and data dictionary are available on this website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/crime-in-baltimore, this analysis uses a subset of the data.

Based on Figure 1, we can see that crime rate does not increase steadily over time, and instead follows a yearly cyclical pattern. Crime does not stay constant and district is an important factor to consider. First, we will talk about monthly crime. Based on Figure 3: in each month, the crimes in the Northeastern and Southeastern district are the highest, while the crimes in the Western and Eastern districts are the lowest. There is more crime in summer months across districts. Second, we will talk about hourly crime. There is an increasing trend of crime after 5:00am that reaches its peak from 12:00pm to 8:00pm based on Figure 2. Law enforcement should increase resource allotment between the months of April and August to deal with increased crime. In addition, they should similarly focus daily resources between 3:00pm to 9:59pm due to the higher frequency of crime during those hours. Law enforcement should enact more safety programs and perhaps implement more/better trained police officers in the Northeastern and Southeastern districts. It is important to recognize that Baltimore community members may not feel safer with increased police presence due to the history of police violence in this community.
